"""
GPU/Ollama coordination across apps (Backlog 0.7).

This module provides two coordination primitives:

  • OllamaCoordinator — for inference (seconds-long calls). Layered as
    per-app asyncio.Lock + cross-app dollar-at-risk priority via shared
    coord file. Designed to be best-effort: missing file is fine,
    stale entries are fine, never raises.

  • acquire_training_mutex / release_training_mutex — for retraining
    (minutes-long blocking GPU events). Sync API (training runs in a
    thread). One holder at a time across apps via a separate lock
    file. Stale-PID reclaim handles crashed peers.

Coordinates Ollama call serialization across `trading_app` and
`polymarket_app`, both of which run on the same machine and compete
for one Ollama instance / RTX 2060 GPU.

Two layers:

1. **Per-app asyncio.Lock** (Option E in the design doc) — at most one
   Ollama call from this app is in-flight at a time. Trivially correct
   within a single process; benefits: no concurrent CNN-agent +
   sentiment-agent + claude-agent calls hammering Ollama from inside
   trading_app.

2. **Cross-app dollar-at-risk priority** (Option H) — the coord file
   `~/.ollama-coord/state.json` (or `OLLAMA_COORD_FILE` env override)
   tracks each app's current `exposure_usd`. Whichever app has more
   capital deployed gets the next call. The other app yields up to a
   bounded wait, then fires anyway (better to miss the priority than
   to skip a cycle entirely).

Idempotent and tolerant: if the coord file is missing or unreadable,
the coordinator falls back to lock-only behavior and logs at debug.
The other app being absent simply means we always win the priority
contest — also fine.
